💡 How It Works
Input Symptoms: User selects or types their symptoms.

Prediction: A trained ML model predicts the most likely disease.

Suggestions:

Medication: Generic drugs or treatment guidance.

Diet Plan: Foods to consume or avoid.

Workout Precautions: Activities to avoid based on condition.

📊 Dataset
Symptom-disease dataset used for training the model.

Model trained using classification algorithms like Decision Tree / Random Forest.

🧪 Example
Input: Headache, Fever, Nausea
Output: Dengue
Medication: Paracetamol, IV fluids
Diet: High fluid intake, fruits
Precautions: Avoid strenuous exercise

📌 To-Do / Future Improvements
Add user authentication

Improve UI/UX with animations

Integrate voice input

Deploy online (e.g., using Render/Heroku)
